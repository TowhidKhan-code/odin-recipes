  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It&lsquo;s flavored with garlic, onions, ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. </p>
  <p>Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish&lsquo;s origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants. </p>
